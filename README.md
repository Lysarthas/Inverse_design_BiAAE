Code for paper [Bidirectional Adversarial Autoencoders for the design of Plasmonic Metasurfaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04056).

Inverse design of Plasmonic Metasurfaces with [Bidirectional Adversarial AutoEncoder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7182000/pdf/fphar-11-00269.pdf).

The model is built with "*tensorflow2*", please check the "**requirement.txt**" and decide which package you need to run the model.

Jupyter Notebook "**biaae_eval**" provide a tutorial for running the model.
